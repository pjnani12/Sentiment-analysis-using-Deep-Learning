Abstract:
Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest growing research area, which helps customers to make better-informed purchase decisions through proper understanding and analysis of collective sentiments from the web and social media. It also provides organizations the ability to measure the impact of their social marketing strategies by identifying the public emotions towards the product or the events associated to them. Most of the studies done so far have focused on obtaining sentiment features by analyzing syntactic and lexical features that were explicitly expressed through sentiment words, emoticons and other special symbols. In this paper, we propose an approach to carry out the sentiment analysis of product reviews using deep learning. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, deep learning models do not depend on feature extractors as these features are learned directly during the training process. The main idea in this work is to use word2vec to learn word embedding and convolution neural networks to train and classify the sentiment classes of the product reviews. This combined word2vec-CNN model can be used to predict the sentiment of new product reviews.
